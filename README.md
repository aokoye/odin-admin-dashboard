# The Odin Project: Admin Dashboard

### Project goals:
This the final project for the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course on the Odin project. The goal for this project was to use grid for most if not all of the layout as the last part of the course was spent teaching grid (flex was taught in an earlier section).

### Process:
I found this project mildly challenging, primarily with regards to making sure that there wasn't a bunch of empty space. Once I figured that out it was smooth sailing. That said, I do think that overall I need to keep practicing with grid in order to become more comfortable with it.

Outside of the coding, I tried to have fun with this project. Anyone who knows me knows that I love cooking and baking and people who know me well will spot a few other things hiding in plain sight that are very "me".
